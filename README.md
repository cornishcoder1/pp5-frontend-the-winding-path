# Project Setup

1. Create a new repository in GitHub (do not use CI Template).

2. Create new workspace by clicking 'Gitpod' button. 

3. Once workspace has loaded, run terminal command **npx create-react-app . --use-npm** to create React app. 

4. Once the app is installed, run terminal command **npm start** to check app is working. Browser should open with the spinning React logo on a dark blue background. 

5. Remove logo import from the top of App.js, and replace the React Header element with a custom h1 element containing 'Hello World!'. 

6. Confirm the changes have rendered in the browser preview then add, commit and push changes. 

7. Create a new app in Heroku. 

8. Go to 'Settings' and ensure that **heroku/nodejs** buildpack is present. If it is not, click on 'Add Buildpack', select 'nodejs' and save changes.

9. Click on the 'Deploy' tab and go to 'Deployment Method'. Click on GitHub. 

10. Go to 'App connected to GitHub' and search for the relevant repository. Select that repository and click 'Connect'.

11. Go to 'Manual Deploy' section and click 'Deploy Branch'. Click on 'build logs' to monitor build and ensure deployment is successful. Build is complete when log states 'Build succeeded!'. 

12. Click 'Open App' button to view newly deployed app.
