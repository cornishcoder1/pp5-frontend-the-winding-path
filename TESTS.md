# Validator testing

## ES Lint

The following errors were detected by ES Lint: 

1. "{prop}is missing in props validation" - ES Lint identified this error across a number of js files. The following solution suggested by sean_ci on Slack was used to stop these errors from appearing: 

![Validator testing](src/assets/testing_screenshots/prop_types_rule.png)

2. "Component definition is missing display name" - This error related to the 'ThreeDots' component in MoreDropDown.js. The following solution given by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/3617886/tholle" title="Tholle">Tholle</a> on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52992932/component-definition-is-missing-display-name-react-display-name" title="Stackoverflow">Stackoverflow</a> was used to rectify this error: 

![Validator testing](src/assets/testing_screenshots/stackoverflow_solution.png)

3. "Do not pass children as props" - This error has been intentionally ignored as it is in relation to code that was provided in the Moments Walkthrough project. I have added ```/*eslint-disable*/``` to the top of the js files concerned and have also listed them in the .eslintignore file.  

## W3C CSS

All CSS code passed through the validator with no issues: 

![Validator testing](src/assets/testing_screenshots/css_validation.png)

# Responsive Testing

The website has been tested using the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Safari

The website has been tested on the following devices: 

- MacBook Air
- Dell Latitude 5300
- iPhone SE 2020

The following emulated devices have been tested in Dev Tools:

- iPhone XR
- iPhone 12 Pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- iPad Air
- iPad Mini
- Galaxy A51/71 

During testing it was found that users are unable to log in if using Firefox and Safari. It was suggested by a fellow student on Slack that this may be because third party cookies are being blocked, however no solution was provided. 

The only layout issue encountered was that the 'About' page had some excess whitespace at the bottom on some smaller screen sizes.
